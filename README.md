# Hey, I'm Razvan

I'm getting into software engineering after working in engineering and compliance. Most of what I build started as a way to make my own work easier—small tools, automations, and Chrome extensions that save time or reduce repetitive tasks.

I'm still improving as a developer, but I enjoy figuring things out, breaking problems down, and building practical solutions. I use AI as a helper when I get stuck or want to move faster, but I always try to understand the logic behind the code I write.

## What I like working on
- Small automation tools
- Chrome extensions
- React apps and simple UI tools
- Projects that remove repetitive tasks
- Learning how to write cleaner, more structured code

## Projects

### Com-Plate
A Chrome extension for inserting preset messages into Amazon’s internal tools. I originally built it for myself, but it grew into something others found useful.

### Blurbinator
A floating React UI that helps organize blurbs into categories. It loads JSON files, supports dark mode, and works like a small bubble on the screen.

### AIP
A small browser script that opens emails and highlights the ones with attachments. Built without access to internal APIs, so everything works through the DOM.

## What I'm learning right now
- Getting stronger with JavaScript and React
- Writing cleaner components
- Understanding patterns instead of relying on trial and error
- Becoming more confident writing code without help

## What I'm looking for
A junior developer role where I can grow, learn from others, and work on real products. I like building things that genuinely help people, even in small ways.
